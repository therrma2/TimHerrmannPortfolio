## My Story

After graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in General Engineering, I found myself working in supply chain management for a major corporation.  Everything went well, but after 6 years, multiple promotions, and several relocations, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.  I finally took a leap of faith and left to pursue something I'd become passionate about.  Robotics.

So here I am, starting a new chapter of my life as a graduate student in the Master's of Science in Robotics (MSR) program at Northwestern University.  Check back thoughout the year as I update this portfolio with all sorts of cool projects.
