## About Me

I am currently completing a Masters of Science in Robotics and Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, expecting to graduate in December 2016.  I also have a Bachelor's of Science in General Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My path to this point has been a bit unusual in that I spend 6 years working in logistics for a major food and beverage manufacturer before making the decision to return to my engineering roots.  I choose to leave a successful career in order to pursue a more fulfilling and personally rewarding career in robotics.

I'm interested in all things robotics, but specifically:
* Computer Vision
* Mechatronics
* Manipulation

My dream jobs would be working on a Mars Rover, or created fun robotic toys and gadgets.
